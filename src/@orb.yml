  A orb containing command and jobs related to testing Ansible collections.
  This orb was created to test the collections in https://github.com/maxhoesel-ansible and makes a lot of assumptions about your collection.
  You may still find some of its contents useful however.
  See the collections in https://github.com/maxhoesel-ansible for usage examples

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.
