  Installs Podman on an Ubuntu-based executor, using the kubic project repositories.
  Needs at least Ubuntu 22.04
steps:
  - run:
      # Perform a manual install of Podman using the Kubic project repository.
      # This is pretty nasty but our best option until 24.04 hopefully ships with Podman 4.X or CircleCI adds other machine images with Alma/Arch
      name: Install Podman
      command: <<include(scripts/install-podman.sh)>>
